### EGI.eu Statutes and Governance Bodies
The EGI Foundation (a.k.a. EGI.eu) has adopted the legal form of a ‘Foundation’ under Dutch law. Its statutes were updated during 2015 and define the objectives of the foundation, the composition in terms of participants and associated participants, the organisation and tasks of the Council and Executive Board (EB), the role of the Director. For more information about benefits and options for joining the EGI Federation, please check the dedicated brochure [_Joining the EGI Federation_](https://go.egi.eu/join).

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/EGI-Governing-Bodies.png" alt="EGI Governing Bodies" style="width:60vw;"/></p>

#### Council
The [Council](https://www.egi.eu/about/egi-council/) is the supervisory authority and monitors the general course of affairs in the Foundation. It consists of participants and associated participants of the foundation. Only participants have voting rights proportional to the paid fee, while associated participants cannot vote. The Council is also responsible for appointing the chairperson and the members of the Executive Board. The Terms of Reference (ToR) for the Council is defined by the EGI.eu Statutes and by a [dedicated ToR](https://documents.egi.eu/document/152).

#### Executive Board
The Executive Board is charged with the management of the foundation, for which it is accountable to the Council. It is composed from minimally five and maximally nine members appointed for a maximum period of two years. A number of resolutions of the Executive Board are subject to the approval of the Council (e.g. adoption of the budget, employment conditions of the personnel employed by the foundation). The Executive Board devolves financial and organisational responsibility to the EGI.eu Director, who is supported by a staff of ~20 people based at the EGI.eu headquarters in Amsterdam with some limited remote working staff. The Terms of Reference for the EB is defined by the EGI.eu Statutes and by a [dedicated ToR](https://documents.egi.eu/document/151).

#### EGI Foundation Participants
Participants and Associated Participants can be NGIs, EIROs, ERICs and such other legal entities, in their own capacity or as representative of a consortium, that contribute to the objective of the foundation. In the case of consortium representatives, membership is subject to there being a letter of support from the appropriate relevant authority indicating how the identified organisation represents the National e-Infrastructure strategy. Representation within the EGI Council would be determined by the lead member within the organisation or as defined in its statutes or within a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for membership with EGI. By being an EGI.eu participant, an organisation benefits from a set of activities that are delivered by EGI.eu in collaboration with a sub-set of participants listed in the [EGI Internal Service Portfolio](https://confluence.egi.eu/display/IMS/EGI+Internal+Service+Portfolio).

### Other relevant groups

#### Strategy and Innovation Board (SIB)
The Strategy and Innovation Board is an external advisory body that provides advice and guidance to the EGI council and to EGI.eu leadership about the strategy in the area of: relationship and service provision to user communities, relationship to other e-Infrastructures, relationship to industry, technology and innovation; e-Infrastructure organisation and management. The SIB will have ownership of strategy and innovation recommendations, which are intended to be formalised within a living document that will be maintained and updated through regular meetings. Members of the SIB will be appointed during 2017 by the EB.

#### Project Advisory Committee (PAC)
The Project Advisory Committee is an advisory body to the EGI Executive Board and through the Executive Board the Council, on the EGI Federation priorities regarding the participation in projects. It provides directly or indirectly input to external funding agencies on EGI Federation priorities in consultation with the Executive Board, gathers input from EGI Participants on priorities and orientations, oversees the EGI Federation response to the various calls and project funding opportunities, advises the EGI Federation on the medium and long term strategic issues related to the participation in foreseeable funding programmes initiated by the European Commission and other funding bodies in Europe and beyond.

#### User Community Board (UCB)
The User Community Board gathers feedback from the user community relating to the quality of the production infrastructure and prioritises issues requiring management attention for resolution through the OMB. It also defines and prioritises requirements relating to new functionality in the production infrastructure or the user-facing operational tools. The UCB includes representatives from the research communities and projects served by EGI.

#### Community Managers Group (CMG)
EGI members (NGIs, EIROs, RIs and institutes) can delegate contacts to the [EGI Community Managers](https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIBG/Community+Managers) network. The EGI Community Managers network is an information-sharing network about user engagement, training, technical support and partner liaison activities in the EGI context. Members of the network have regular meetings and an email list to share information about their activities, and to exchange success stories and best practices between the European and national/community/institutional landscapes.

#### Operations Management Board (OMB)
The Operations Management Board is an advisory body, which develops strategy and technical priorities concerning the deployment and operation of the production infrastructure, oversees the status and progress of the global EGI operational services and of the NGI operational services. Responsibilities of the OMB include the development of policies and procedures that require formal consensus from the NGI operations managers and their respective resource providers, the collection of requirements from the EGI resource providers, the definition of work plans the long-term development of the EGI operations.

#### Technology Coordination Board (TCB)
The TCB (“the Group”) has been established to coordinate the identification, testing, validation, adoption, provisioning, and decommissioning of existing and future technologies relevant to the delivery of the EGI Service Portfolio. Specific responsibilities include:

1. the appointment of technical area coordinators in ICT domains identified to be relevant to the EGI Service Portfolio;
1. the definition and maintenance of the EGI Federation Technical Plan, defining the EGI Federation service architecture, the technical specifications of the EGI portfolio services and their interoperability guidelines in collaboration with working groups, technology providers, service providers and user communities;
1. The setup and coordination of working groups contributing to the definition of the technical plan in specific areas relevant to the EGI service portfolio;
1. The consultation with relevant stakeholders for any matter that concerns the EGI technical plan, through face to face meetings and online channels (webinars, surveys, etc.);
1. The liaison with external e-Infrastructures and research infrastructures on matters concerning the adoption, integration with and evolution of the technical solutions adopted by the EGI service portfolio;
1. The advice and report to the Executive Board and the Council.

The Group contributes to IT Service Management activities according to EGI’s Service Management Policy. See [ToR](https://documents.egi.eu/document/109) and related [confluence space](https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIBG/Technology+Coordination+Board).

#### UMD Release Team (URT)
The [Unified Middleware Distribution](https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIG/Unified+Middleware+Distribution) (UMD) Release Team is a coordination group, under the EGI Operations umbrella. The goal of URT is to continue some of the coordination activities carried out by the European middleware projects, keep the communications active between product teams and to open a new communication channel between the EGI and the middleware developers.

The ultimate aim of URT is to keep releasing quality software, to be distributed in UMD.

#### Services and Solutions Board (SSB)
The [Services and Solutions Board](https://confluence.egi.eu/display/IMS/Services+and+Solutions+Board+-+SSB) is responsible for managing the portfolio of services and solutions regarding EGI.eu and the EGI federated services. This includes all services and solutions that are planned, active or to be retired. The SSB also conducts regularly scheduled management reviews of both services and solutions portfolios and related ITSM processes. It also collects inputs from the UCB concerning the services and solutions for the research communities, from the TCB concerning the evolution of technology and how this can affect services and solutions; from the OMB concerning the services and solutions for resource providers.

#### Security Policy Group (SPG)
The Security Policy Group is responsible for developing the policy needed to provide a secure, trustworthy distributed computing infrastructure. The SPG output defines the behaviour expected from NGIs, Sites, Users and other participants to maintain a beneficial and effective working environment. The SPG also seeks to prepare and maintain simple and general policies which are not only applicable to EGI, but also to other distributed computing infrastructures.

#### Software Vulnerability Group (SVG)
The purpose of the EGI Software Vulnerability Group is to minimise the risk to all service providers, infrastructures, users and other parties which interact with the EOSC-hub, arising from vulnerabilities in software deployed on the constituents of the distributed infrastructure. In essence, to minimise the risk of security incidents due to software vulnerabilities.

#### Computer Security and Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
The EGI Computer Security and Incident Response Team provides operational security for the EGI Infrastructure. This includes responding to computer security incidents affecting the infrastructure, which is carried out by coordinating the incident handling activities in the NGIs/EIROs, RCs, VOs, and where applicable interacting with partner Infrastructures CSIRTs and CSIRT communities with which EGI-CSIRT has a trust relationship. If needed RCs are provided with expert level forensics support for the incident resolution. EGI-CSIRT also provides preventive and educational services such as security monitoring, vulnerability assessment, advisories to mitigate risks due to vulnerabilities, and security training. To improve collaboration in the field of IT-Security EGI-CSIRT actively reaches out to CSIRT communities and is an active member of TI TF-CSIRT. The EGI CSIRT is led and coordinated by the EGI Security Officer.');
